# The-analysis-of-passwords
This project utilized two password data sets. One is RockYou data set, which was from the RockYou company leaked in 2009. The other is 1.4 Billion Password data set dump firstly was found in an underground community forum in 2017. I also concluded all the characteristics of the passwords including numbers, letters, and special symbols. Meanwhile, I took advantage of zxcvbn scores, t-Test, and machine learning to get deep research into the passwords.
